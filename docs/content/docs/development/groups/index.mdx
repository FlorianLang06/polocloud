## What are Groups?

In PoloCloud, a **Group** represents a logical collection or category of services.  
Groups help you organize and manage services by their function, environment, or any custom classification.

Typical examples of groups include:  
- "lobby" for lobby servers  
- "proxy" for proxy servers  
- "bw-8x1" for minigame servers like bedwars

Groups allow filtering, bulk operations, and easier service discovery.

## Group-related enums and constants

See the [Group Types](./groups/group-types) page for an overview of all `GroupType` enums (e.g., SERVICE, SERVER, PROXY) to understand how groups categorize services.
