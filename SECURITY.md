# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We always support our latest release.  
If an issue occurs in an older version, we may discontinue it and take it down.  
However, we do not provide updates or security patches for older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please notify us immediately.

We take all valid reports seriously and will investigate them promptly to resolve any issues as quickly as possible.

We prefer that you use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting feature to disclose potential security issues in our open source software.

To do so, please visit the **Security** tab of this repository and click the **“Report a vulnerability”** button.
